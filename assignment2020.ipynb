    "Numerical Python more commonly referred to as NumPy is an open source Python library created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It contains multi-dimensional array and matrix data structures. Multi-dimensional arrays have more than one column (dimension), consider it like an excel spreadsheet. (Malik, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy also has a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. One of the main uses of NumPy is its use in data analysis *“as a container for data to be passed between algorithms and libraries”*.(McKinney, 2018). These capabilities mean *“many numerical computing tools for Python either assume NumPy arrays as a primary data structure or else target seamless interoperability with NumPy”*. (McKinney, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before explaining the overall purpose of the numpy.random module let’s have a quick overview of what random numbers are. Random refers to something that cannot be predicted logically. Randomness is useful in many areas such as simulating the impact of chance on stock markets or in the selection of representative samples of patients when testing new drugs. (Matthews, 2020). However, there is a problem when using randomness for making unbiased choices and that comes down to bias. *“The lack of bias only really appears in an infinitely long set of random numbers. In any given collection, there can be astonishingly long patterns”*. (Matthews, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True-Random: Truly random number sequences are generated by chance that contain no recognisable pattern or regularity. (Spacey, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pseudo-Random: generated by computers, are not random as they are deterministic devices i.e., they are predictable by design. *“So, to create something unpredictable, they use mathematical algorithms to produce numbers that are random enough”*. (ComputerHope, 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `numpy.random` module adds to the already built in Python `random` *“with functions for efficiently generating whole arrays of sample values from many kinds of probability distributions”*. (McKinney, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Numpy.random` and Python `random` although sharing the same algorithm work in different ways. In terms of efficiency, NumPy is most likely to perform better because arrays can be created without the need of a loop. (DiTect, 2020). Note the algorithm used by NumPy has now changed. Previously Numpy used the Mersenne Twister as the core generator but with the introduction of the latest version 1.19 the core generator is now PCG64.\n"
